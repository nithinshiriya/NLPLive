Knowing about the progress and performance of a model, as we train them, could be very helpful in understanding itâ€™s learning process and makes it easier to debug and optimize them. In this notebook, we will learn how to visualize training statistics for LDA topic model in gensim. To monitor the training, a list of Metrics is passed to the LDA function call for plotting their values live as the training progresses.
